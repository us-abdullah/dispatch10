# Real-World Data Integration for DispatchAI Copilot

## üéØ Overview

DispatchAI Copilot now integrates with **real 911 datasets** from NYC, Seattle, and NENA (National Emergency Number Association) standards to provide accurate, data-driven incident classification and prioritization.

## üìä Data Sources

### **NYC 911 Data**
- **Source**: [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/76xm-jjuj.json)
- **Coverage**: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island
- **Data Points**: 
  - Call types (RESPFC, DIFFFC, INJURY, UNC, CVAC, DRUG, etc.)
  - Severity levels (1-6 scale)
  - Response times and dispatch patterns
  - Geographic distribution and demographics

### **Seattle 911 Data**
- **Source**: Seattle Police Department Real-Time Data
- **Coverage**: All Seattle districts and neighborhoods
- **Data Points**:
  - Call types (219-STABBING, 240-ASSAULT, 100A-ALARM, etc.)
  - Priority levels (A/B/C system)
  - Response times and disposition codes
  - Geographic and temporal patterns

### **NENA Standards**
- **Source**: National Emergency Number Association
- **Coverage**: National standards for 911 dispatch
- **Data Points**:

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Real-World Classification System**
```javascript
// Based on actual 911 data patterns
const classification = {
    category: 'Police/Fire/Medical',
    priority: 'High/Medium/Low',
    severity: 1-6, // Based on real severity codes
    nenaCode: 'E/P1/P2', // NENA standard codes
    confidence: 85, // Data-driven confidence scoring
    responseTime: '7 minutes', // Based on real response data
    dataSource: 'NYC/Seattle/NENA datasets'
};
```

### **Data-Driven Analysis**
- **Keyword Extraction**: Based on real call type descriptions
- **Priority Mapping**: Uses actual severity level distributions
- **Response Time Targets**: Based on real performance data
- **Routing Suggestions**: Derived from actual dispatch patterns
