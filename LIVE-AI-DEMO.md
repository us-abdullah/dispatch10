# Live AI Processing Demo Guide

## üéØ What's New - Live AI Analysis

The DispatchAI Copilot now features **real-time AI processing** of live call transcripts! As you speak during a call, the AI continuously analyzes the transcript and updates all features in real-time.

## ‚ú® Live AI Features

### **Real-Time Processing**
- **Live Transcript Analysis**: Every few seconds, the AI processes new transcript content
- **Dynamic Updates**: All UI elements update automatically as the call progresses
- **Smart Throttling**: AI only processes when there's significant new content (30+ characters)
- **Visual Indicators**: Processing spinner shows when AI is analyzing

### **Live-Updating Elements**
1. **Urgent Brief** - Updates with priority and key details
2. **Incident Summary** - Who/What/Where/When/Injuries/Suspects
3. **Suggested Questions** - AI-generated follow-up questions
4. **Incident Classification** - Police/Fire/Medical with priority
5. **Routing Suggestions** - Recommended emergency units
6. **Confidence Scoring** - Real-time confidence levels

## üöÄ Demo Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Armed Robbery (Progressive Build-up)**
**Start with:** "This is 911, I'm calling about a robbery..."
- **Initial Analysis**: Low priority, basic incident
- **Add Details**: "Two men with guns just robbed the convenience store..."
- **Live Update**: Priority changes to HIGH, adds suspect details
- **Final Details**: "They're fleeing north in a black sedan..."
- **Live Update**: Adds direction, updates routing suggestions

### **Scenario 2: House Fire (Escalating Emergency)**
**Start with:** "There's smoke coming from my house..."
- **Initial Analysis**: Fire category, medium priority
- **Add Details**: "I can see flames on the second floor..."
- **Live Update**: Priority escalates to HIGH
- **Critical Info**: "I think someone might still be inside..."
- **Live Update**: Adds trapped person, updates to highest priority

### **Scenario 3: Medical Emergency (Symptom Progression)**
**Start with:** "I need an ambulance, my husband is sick..."
- **Initial Analysis**: Medical category, medium priority
- **Add Symptoms**: "He's having chest pain and can't breathe..."
- **Live Update**: Priority escalates to HIGH, adds cardiac symptoms
- **Critical Details**: "He's 65 with heart problems..."
- **Live Update**: Adds age/medical history, suggests cardiac response

## üéÆ How to Demo

### **Step 1: Start the Call**
1. Click "Start Call" button
2. Watch the status change to "Recording"
3. Notice the AI status indicator (ü§ñ Mock AI or üß† Ollama AI)

### **Step 2: Begin Speaking**
1. Start with basic information
2. Watch the transcript appear in real-time
3. Notice the AI processing indicator appears
4. See the first analysis results

### **Step 3: Add Details Gradually**
1. Pause between sentences (2-second delay for AI processing)
2. Add more specific details
3. Watch all elements update live:
   - Urgent brief changes priority
   - Summary fills in details
   - Questions become more specific
   - Classification becomes more accurate

### **Step 4: Show Real-Time Updates**
1. Point out the processing spinner
2. Show how priority changes from LOW ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí HIGH
3. Demonstrate how questions become more relevant
4. Show routing suggestions updating

## üîß Technical Details

### **Processing Logic**
- **Trigger**: Every time final transcript text is added
- **Throttling**: 2-second delay after last update
- **Minimum Content**: 20+ characters, 30+ new characters
- **AI Type**: Automatically uses Ollama if available, falls back to Mock AI

### **Visual Indicators**
- **Processing Spinner**: Shows in urgent brief header
- **Notifications**: "AI analyzing live transcript..."
- **Status Updates**: "Live analysis updated (Ollama AI)"
- **AI Badge**: Shows which AI system is active

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Smart Throttling**: Prevents excessive AI calls
- **Content Filtering**: Only processes meaningful content
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to Mock AI
- **Memory Management**: Efficient transcript processing

## üìä Expected Demo Flow

### **Timeline Example (Armed Robbery)**
```
0:00 - "This is 911, I'm calling about a robbery..."
0:02 - AI Processing... (Mock AI)
0:03 - Analysis: LOW priority, basic incident
0:05 - "Two men with guns just robbed the store..."
0:07 - AI Processing... (Mock AI)
0:08 - Analysis: HIGH priority, armed suspects
0:10 - "They're fleeing north in a black sedan..."
0:12 - AI Processing... (Mock AI)
0:13 - Analysis: Updated routing, specific direction
```

### **UI Updates to Highlight**
1. **Urgent Brief**: Changes from generic to specific
2. **Priority Badge**: LOW ‚Üí HIGH with color change
3. **Summary Grid**: Fills in Who/What/Where details
4. **Questions**: Become more specific and relevant
5. **Classification**: Becomes more accurate
6. **Routing**: Adds specific units needed

## üéØ Demo Tips

### **For Hackathon Presentation**
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic incident description
2. **Build Drama**: Add critical details gradually
3. **Point Out Changes**: Highlight real-time updates
4. **Show Processing**: Demonstrate AI working live
5. **Explain Fallback**: Show Mock AI vs Ollama AI

### **Best Practices**
- **Speak Clearly**: Better transcription = better AI analysis
- **Pause Between Details**: Allows AI to process each update
- **Use Realistic Scenarios**: More engaging for audience
- **Show Both Modes**: Demonstrate with and without Ollama

### **Troubleshooting**
- **No Updates**: Check if transcript is building
- **Slow Processing**: Normal with Ollama, faster with Mock AI
- **Errors**: App automatically falls back to Mock AI
- **CORS Issues**: Use HTTP server, not file:// protocol

## üîç What to Look For

### **Real-Time Indicators**
- Processing spinner in urgent brief header
- Notification toasts showing AI activity
- Status badge showing AI type (Mock/Ollama)
- Console logs showing analysis progress

### **Content Updates**
- Urgent brief becoming more specific
- Priority level changing based on severity
- Summary details filling in as you speak
- Questions becoming more relevant
- Routing suggestions updating

### **AI Quality**
- **Mock AI**: Fast, keyword-based, very reliable
- **Ollama AI**: More sophisticated, context-aware
- **Fallback**: Seamless switching between modes

The live AI processing makes the demo much more impressive and shows the real-time capabilities of the system!
